- 👋 Hi, I’m @Catalin
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a career into IT, QA / software tester to be more exact
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the manual side of software testing and finished a course at a local institute
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more about what a manual QA does and in the future move towards automation software testing.
